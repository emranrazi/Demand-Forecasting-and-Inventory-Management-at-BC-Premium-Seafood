### I. Introduction
BC Premium Seafood, a Canadian company specializing in canned seafood products, faces challenges in operational costs, poor demand forecasting, and inadequate inventory management. This report aims to offer recommendations to improve the company's forecasting and inventory processes.

### II. Demand Forecasting
To enhance demand forecasting, a coordinated approach across the supply chain is recommended. This entails collaborative forecasting between production, warehouses, and distribution centers to ensure accurate and synchronized forecasts. Advanced techniques like machine learning can also improve accuracy. Excel was used for visualization, utilizing the "Data" dataset.
